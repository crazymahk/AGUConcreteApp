        <p>A concrete mix is a combination of five major elements in various 
        proportions:
          cement, water, coarse aggregates, fine aggregates (i.e. sand), and air. Additional elements such as
           pozzolanic materials and chemical admixtures can also be incorporated into the mix to give it certain
            desirable properties. While a concrete mix design is a process of selecting ingredients for a concrete
            mixture and deciding on their proportions. When designing a mix, you should always consider the desired
            strength, durability, and workability of the concrete for the project in question.</p>
            <p>Needless to say, all ready-mix producers strive to find the perfect proportions of these ingredients in order
            to optimize their concrete mixes and give their concrete strength, durability, workability, and other
            desirable properties. Itâ€™s important to optimize concrete to ensure the lowest cost while maintaining the
            highest strength of your mixture. This is far from easy, as every addition or subtraction to the concrete
            mix entails adjustments to the components, making the process very complicated and inefficient.</p>

        <h2>How to Design a Concrete Mix</h2>
    
        <h3>Step 1: Air Content</h3>
        <p>The first step of this software is to decide the air content of concrete</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The concrete mix design app suggest air-entrained and non-air entrained option in the first papge of Design panel</li>
            <li>The entrapped air is an important parameter when the concrete structure is exposed to freezing or
                de-icing salts. In such conditions, increased air content will increase concrete durability because it
                allows the water to expand in the entrapped air when it freezes. This reduces the internal pressure
                caused by the formation of ice.</li>
            <li>If all required data were entered. The concrete mix design app automatically calculates the water weight and the amount of entrapped air required based on the recommended values of ACI committee Tables 6.3.3/ A1.5.3.3.</li>
        </ul>

                <h3>Step 2: Concrete Strength and Water/Cement Ratio</h3>
        <p>The water/cement ratio is the most important parameter of the concrete mix design; it governs the strength,
            durability, and workability of the concrete mix. Here, you will need to select the required compressive
            strength then app will associated water/cement ratio.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For example, reducing the water/cement ratio will increase the strength of the concrete and provide
                better durability. However, decreasing the water/cement ratio can also significantly reduce the
                workability of the concrete. In these cases, one possible solution is adding water reducer to the mix
                </li>
            <li>In this step, you can choose 6 different compressive strength value</li>
            <li>Using your input data, the app will calculate the required water/cement ration. Note that the amount of
                cement can be reduced by introducing pozzolanic materials to the mix.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 3: Maximum Aggregate Size</h3>
        <p>You will also need to define the aggregate size required for the mix design.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In this steps you can select maximum aggregate size (ASTM Standard)
            </li>
            <li>In general, the maximal dimension of the coarse aggregate is governed by the limitations of the
                structure cross-section and reinforcement design.</li>
            <li>Increasing the aggregate size is usually more economical as it reduces the amount of cement per unit of
                volume; however, it may affect the workability of the mix. In contrast, reducing the maximal size of the
                coarse aggregate allows your concrete mix to reach higher strength at an equivalent water-cement ratio.
            </li>

        </ul>

        </figure>

        <h3>Step 4: Slump Flow</h3>
        <p>The fourth step of the process to define the maximum and minimum slump for the fresh mix
            properties.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the flow dimensions are unknown, you can use the slump selection panel and find to appropriate slump requirements.</li>
            <li>The concrete slump represents the flowability/workability of a concrete mix. For example, a higher slump
                allows for better placement in congested reinforced elements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>*The Help guideline is based on Table 6.3.1 (Table A1.5.3.1) of the ACI standard.</p>

            <figcaption id="caption-attachment-27083" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Standard Practice for Selecting
                Proportions for Normal, Heavyweight, and Mass Concrete (ACI 211.1-91)</figcaption>
       
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Step 5: Coarse Aggregate</h3></br>
        <p>You are now required to define the specific gravity of coarse aggregate and bulk density of coarse aggregate</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The application will then output the quantity of coarse aggregate required.</li>
            
            <li>The calculation is based on values from Table 6.3.6/ A1.5.3.6. This table is based on the workability of
                the concrete.</li>
        </ul>

                Proportions for Normal, Heavyweight, and Mass Concrete (ACI 211.1-91)</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Step 6: Fine Aggregate</h3>
        <p>You are now required to define the specific gravity of fine aggregate and fineness modulus of fine aggregate</p>
        <ul>
           
            <li>Depending on the type of concrete (non-air-entrained or air-entrained), the first estimate of concrete
                weight can be calculated using ACI Table 6.3.7.1/ A1.5.3.7.1,</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You now obtained; the calculated quantity of fine aggregate required for the proposed concrete mix needed for
            the final calculations.</p>
         <img position ="center" src="img/coarse.png"  /> 
         </br>
            <figcaption id="caption-attachment-27087" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Standard Practice for Selecting
                Proportions for Normal, Heavyweight, and Mass Concrete (ACI 211.1-91)</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Step 7: Adjustment for Moisture in Aggregates</h3>
        <p>The last step in the calculations adjusts the amount of water in the mix design based on the input of the
            moisture content and degree of moisture absorption of coarse and fine aggregates.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is important to consider the amount of water the aggregates give to the mix and retrieve from the mix
                because this causes variation in the water/cement ratio.</li>
            <li>The  computes the new quantity of water, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregates based on
                the input values.</li>
            <li>The amount of water can further be reduced with chemical admixtures like water reducer.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Step 8: Summary Design</h3>
        <p>Finally, you can  obtain your summary report and your results in Result panel.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You will be asked to see sieve analysis.</li>
            <li>The app will  display the details of your concrete mix and the quantity of each material required
                for the specified volume of concrete.</li>
            <li>You will be asked to see cost estimation..</li>
        </ul>
